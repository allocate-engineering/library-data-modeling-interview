-- Library Management System Database Schema
-- 
-- TODO: Design and implement the database schema based on the business requirements
-- 
-- Consider the following questions as you design:
-- 1. How will you model books vs physical copies?
-- 2. How will you handle books with multiple authors?
-- 3. What constraints are needed to enforce business rules?
-- 4. What indexes would improve query performance?
-- 5. How will you track checkout history vs current checkouts?
-- 6. How will you prevent double-checkouts of the same copy?
-- 7. How will you efficiently find overdue books?
-- 
-- Your schema should support ALL the business requirements in the README.
-- 
-- Uncomment and modify the examples below or create your own design:

/*
-- Example starting point (modify as needed):

CREATE TABLE authors (
    -- What fields does an author need?
    -- How do you handle author uniqueness?
);

CREATE TABLE books (
    -- What makes a book unique?
    -- What metadata do you need to track?
);

-- How do you handle the many-to-many relationship between books and authors?

-- How do you model physical copies vs logical books?

CREATE TABLE users (
    -- What user information is required?
    -- What constraints prevent duplicate cards?
);

-- How do you model the checkout relationship?
-- Consider: current vs historical checkouts, late fees, etc.

-- What indexes do you need for performance?
